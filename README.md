# KCC Enrollment Meter Pie Charts

#### Just simple enrollment meter and package json here

## Requirements

	- Nodejs - I recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager): https://github.com/creationix/nvm
	- .nvmrc file in this repo will make NVM use Node v8.9.4 (to avoid compatibility issues)
		- Or, if you must - Use the Nodejs installer: https://nodejs.org/

## Installation
	$ git clone https://github.com/KankakeeCommunityCollege/enrollment-meter-piecharts.git
	$ cd enrollment-meter-piecharts
	$ npm install		// May need to prefix command with sudo (if not using NVM)
  
  Convert index.txt to a proper index.html page. Change the JavaScript link to the folder structure assets/js/index.js

## Development
	Then run 
  $ server

This is pre gulp work flow stuff. I will set it up later to do the conversions to index.txt and link change later.
Also, this needs to be made more flexible and have a positive number perspective as well.
