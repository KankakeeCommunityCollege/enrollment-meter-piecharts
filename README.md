  - nvm install 8.9.4
  - nvm alias default 8.9.4

  Convert index.txt to a proper index.html page. Change the JavaScript link to the folder structure assets/js/index.js

This is pre gulp work flow stuff. I will set it up later to do the conversions to index.txt and link change later.
Also, this needs to be made more flexible and have a positive number perspective as well.
